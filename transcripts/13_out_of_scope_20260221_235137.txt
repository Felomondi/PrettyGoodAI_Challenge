[AGENT]   Got It Felix? How may I help you today?

[PATIENT] I'm looking for a restaurant recommendation.

[AGENT]   That's not something we offer. I can help with general questions about the Clinic appointments patient, cases medications, refill and insurance.

[PATIENT] Can you recommend a nearby restaurant instead?

[AGENT]   I'm not able to provide restaurant recommendations. If you have any questions about your Orthopedic care or appointments? I can help with that.

[PATIENT] I would like to book a follow-up appointment.

[AGENT]   Got it for your follow-up appointment. Do you have a preferred provider or day? And time in mind? We have openings this week and early next week.

[AGENT]   No problem, just let me know when you're ready to pick a time or if you have any questions about the appointments.

[PATIENT] Can I get an appointment for this week instead?

[AGENT]   I'm not sure I understand. Are you asking to book a follow-up appointment for this weekend? Or is this about something else?

[AGENT]   Currently the only available follow-up appointments, this week are on Tuesday, February 24th.

[PATIENT] Can I get on a waitlist for this week?

[AGENT]   I can't add you to a wait list directly, but I can let the clinic support team know, you'd like a follow-up appointment. This week, if something opens up, would you like me to document your request for the team to contact you? If an earlier slot becomes available,

[PATIENT] Yes, please document my request for the team to contact me if an earlier slot becomes available.
